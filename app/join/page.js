                            <blockquote>Post-doctoral positions are available to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of protein kinases using computational and experimental techniques. Research experience in molecular biology, molecular evolution, genomics, structural biology or bioinformatics is required. Experience in applying sequence analysis and standard computational tools in a Linux/Unix environment is desirable, but not required.
                                We are an inter-disciplinary research group interested in using the evolutionary information embedded in genomic sequences to understand how signaling proteins, such as protein kinases, work. For more information on what we do, visit our homepage.
